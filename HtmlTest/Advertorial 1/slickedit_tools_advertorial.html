<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>At <a href="http://www.slickedit.com">SlickEdit</a>, our goal is to provide high performance 
tools with innovative features that increase developer productivity. For over eighteen years, our 
commitment has been to provide developers with superior products and services that dramatically 
increase your ability to meet aggressive software development deadlines.  Developers are passionate 
about development tools. We share that passion. Therefore, we use our products daily in our own 
development activities and continually strive to exceed your expectations. 

<p>SlickEdit® Tools for Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2005 offers a robust set of features 
that integrate into the Visual Studio environment, making SlickEdit® Tools an essential productivity 
tool for power programmers.  <a href="http://www.slickedit.com/vstrial">A trial version of the product
may be downloaded by clicking this link.</a>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<h3>Comment Wrapping</h3>
<p>Code editors are designed to excel at formatting code, not plain text files.  For normal coding purposes, 
this is what a developer would expect.  However, when a developer needs to write verbose comments, this 
becomes a real problem.  Every developer has experienced the problem of trying to update multi-line comments 
and having to realign all of the commented text so that the lines have a relatively uniform size.
<p>SlickEdit’s Comment Wrapping solves this problem by enhancing the code editor to wrap comments automatically.
Wrapping works with any type of multi-line comment: line comments, block comments, and XMLdoc and Javadoc 
comments.  Now, when you need to remove two words from the first sentence of a 10-line comment block, all of 
the realignment of your block comment will be done for you, just like word wrap in a word processor.
<p>The following screen shot shows an XMLdoc comment with comment wrapping turned on.
<br>

<p>The next screen shot shows the comment after editing just the first sentence.  The rest of the paragraph is 
naturally wrapped to fit in the defined margins.
<br>

<h3>DIFFzilla®</h3>
<p>DIFFzilla® is a powerful file differencing tool that lets you compare files or directories and view the 
differences side-by-side. You can make edits, merge changes, and save modified files easily within the results 
windows. As edits are made, the diff view is updated as you type, so you don't have to re-run the comparison. 
And, switching from a directory comparison to an individual file difference is as simple as a mouse click.
<br><br>

<h3>Backup History</h3>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">
<p>Many projects have standards for checking in code. Often you might want to view or restore an earlier 
version that is not ready for check-in. Backup History creates files containing just the differences between 
each saved version of a file. This saves disk space and provides a convenient way to access previous versions 
of a file even if it has not been checked into source control. Previous versions may then be reloaded or diffed
using with Diffzilla®.  Backup History does not replace source control... it bridges the gap between check-ins, 
providing a greater safety net for your coding.

<h3>Aliases and Acronyms</h3>
<p>Directory aliases are essentially short identifiers for long directory names, which save a lot of 
typing and mouse use when opening files through the Open File dialog.  There are a handful of directories 
that developers are always browsing to. Defining aliases for these directories means not having to spend lots of 
time navigating to them.
<p>Acronyms, short identifiers for long identifiers, work similarly but are applied to your code. Simply 
type the alias or acronym, and with a key press, it can be expanded to its full text.  By assigning an 
acronym of "msg" to <code>MessageBox.Show</code>, over ten keystrokes can be saved every time you need to show a message 
box.
<p>The list of aliases and acronyms may be easily edited and added to, allowing you to customize them to fit your
needs.

<h3>Quick Profiling</h3>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
    <td colspan="2">
<p>Profiling is the ability to time areas of an application so that bottlenecks can be discovered. There are 
several profilers available that provide full profiling of an application.  However, many of these profilers 
come with limitations:
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top">
<ul>
<li type="disc">The developer must typically profile the entire application.</li>
<li type="disc">The end results are typically far more verbose than what the developer needs.</li>
<li type="disc">It is difficult to compare the results of multiple profiling sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visual Studio itself comes with a profiler that can be added to the solution to instrument code performance. 
However, with this tool, profiling may only be done by launching the application through the profiling tool 
window, and Web applications and services are extremely difficult to profile with it.  It provides very 
little flexibility for determining what specific areas to profile and for viewing the results. 

<p>SlickEdit® Tools offers a unique solution for profiling when a developer wants to fine tune their profiling to get 
information about a specific section of their code.  Quick Profiling provides extremely precise control over 
what code is being timed and how it is being timed.  It allows the developer to time many cases that aren't 
possible with standard profilers, such as timing complex loops, recursive functions, thread synchronization
and the time between an object’s creation and disposal. Furthermore, with the Quick Profiling Report tool, the results of several runs may be compared to view the 
results of code changes and determine the effect of those changes.

<h3>Auto Code Doc Viewer</h3>
<p>Developers have the ability to add XMLdoc to their code elements, similar to Javadoc. 
Microsoft Visual Studio allows the developer to output their XMLdoc comments to an XML file during the build 
step, which is then used for Intellisense®. Unfortunately, Visual Studio 2005 itself does not provide any way to 
turn those comments into documentation for the code base.
<p>The Auto Code Doc Viewer tool provides an easy way to turn your header comments into MSDN-like documentation*.
The tool extracts all header comments, whether they are XMLdoc, line comments, or block comments, and 
will create fully linked HTML help that can be browsed inside Visual Studio as a tool window. All help pages 
provide a link to jump directly to the source code, so it's easy to get from a help page to the actual source 
code.  The generated HTML help pages may also be exported to a folder for viewing in an external Web browser 
and sharing with others.
<br>

<h3>Regex Evaluator</h3>
<p>Regular expressions are used to express text patterns for searching. The Regex Evaluator provides the 
capability to interactively create, save, and re-use tests of regular expressions. It may also be used to 
test regular expressions against the text in the active editor window.
<br><br>

<h3>Icon Extractor</h3>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
    <td valign="top">
<p>One of the most tedious chores of developing an application is adding icons or images to the user interface.  
First, it is often difficult to find good icons or images.  Second, the list of controls that typically need 
icons is long: menus, context menus, toolbar buttons, regular buttons, status bars, even the form itself.  
Finally, the process of adding a single icon or image takes several steps, from finding the right property to 
browsing for the right image file.  
<p>SlickEdit's Icon Extractor is designed to find quality icons and make it as easy as possible to apply them 
to your Windows application.  It has the ability to search Windows executables and DLLs (both managed and 
unmanaged) for embedded icons and images.  These icons and images are presented in a list and can be applied 
to WinForm designer components with simple drag-and-drop operations.  Icons and images may also be exported to
disk for other use.  It is now easy to add that visual “snap” to your applications.
