buddies over and say, "This is cool! Check this out."  Sometimes it happens while developing a prototype or proof of concept.

of them are just for fun.  We hope that as you go through these, at least one of them will make you want to call your office 
mates over to check it out.  Feel free to share these with as many people as you like, and be sure to stop by the

<h3>Editor Gadgets</h3>
<p><b>Editor Gadgets</b> is a collection of four small utilities to add spice to your Visual Studio editor.  Each one may be
enabled or disabled individually.  These gadgets include:
<ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Line ruler -</b> Places a "ruler" highlight across your current line (where the cursor is) and has tick marks to indicate the editor's indentation levels.
	<li><b>Indentation guide -</b> Draws a vertical bar in the editor indicating the indentation level of the current line.
	<li><b>Auto-copy selection -</b> Automatically copies text to the clipboard when selected with the mouse.  Paste may be done by simply clicking in the editor with the middle mouse button (the scroll wheel on most mice).  These behaviors are similar to XMouse.
	<li><b>Editor Graphic -</b> Allows you to place a graphic inside your editor, either as a single image or as a tiled background.
</ul>

<br><b>Dancing banana and the line ruler</b>

<h3>The Command Spy</h3>
Whenever you click on a menu item or toolbar button in Visual Studio, you are executing what is known as a <b>"command"</b>.
Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to tell what command is linked to which menu items or toolbar buttons.  The <b>Command Spy</b> 
monitors command execution and allows you to see exactly what commands you've run, how many times you've run them and what key 
bindings are used to invoke those commands.  The main purpose of this tool is to allow you to learn what commands are bound to 
which keystrokes, so that you can work faster within the IDE.

<h3>File Explorer</h3>

Using Visual Studio's Open File dialog to open files in Visual Studio can be very tedious, especially when you have 
to open files from several different directories.  The <b>File Explorer</b> provides an easy way to open solutions, projects, 
or single files in Visual Studio.  It also makes it easy to drag-and-drop files into an open Visual Studio project.

<h3>The Data Object Analyzer</h3>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0">
<tr>
    <td valign="top">
		Drag-and-drop operations and clipboard operations both work with "data objects".  Data objects contain [1...n] data items, 
		which may be of any type, and are stored with an associated string-based key.  There are some standards about what key/data 
		pairs are used in clipboard or drag-and-drop operations, but for the most part, applications add whatever data they want.  
		If you're writing an application that requires clipboard or drag-and-drop integration, it is important to understand 
		what data is expected from other applications.
		<br><br>
		The <b>Data Object Analyzer</b> solves this problem by inspecting the contents of any clipboard operation, or drag-and-drop operation, 
		from any other application.  The <b>Data Object Analyzer</b> can then be used to automatically generate functions to handle any clipboard 
		or drag-and-drop data.

<h3>The <abbr title="Source Lines of Code">SLOC</abbr> Report</h3>

The <b>SLOC Report</b> provides an easy way to count the lines of code.  The line count is divided into three categories; 
code, comments, and whitespace.  Once the lines of code have been counted, the results are drawn as a pie graph.  SLOC reports 
may be generated for solutions, projects or individual files.
